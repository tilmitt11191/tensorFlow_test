b ( x ) . The quotient polynomial is chosen so that the leading term of qk ( x ) rk − 1 ( x ) equals the leading term of rk − 2 ( x ) ; this ensures that the degree of each remainder is smaller than the degree of its predecessor deg [ rk ( x ) ] < deg [ rk − 1 ( x ) ] . Since the degree is a nonnegative integer , and since it decreases with every step , the Euclidean algorithm concludes in a finite number of steps . The final nonzero remainder is the greatest common divisor of the original two polynomials , a ( x ) and b ( x ) .

log ( c ) + log ( d ) expresses a group isomorphism between positive reals under multiplication and reals under addition . Logarithmic functions are the only continuous isomorphisms between these groups . By means of that isomorphism , the Haar measure ( Lebesgue measure ) dx on the reals corresponds to the Haar measure dx / x on the positive reals . In complex analysis and algebraic geometry , differential forms of the form df / f are known as forms with logarithmic poles .

For the small alkali cations like Na , the crystal structure is tetragonal , whereas it lowers to orthorphombic for larger cations K + , Rb + , Cs + or NH4 + . A similar variation was observed for the M2PaF7 fluorides , namely the crystal symmetry was dependent on the cation and differed for Cs2PaF7 and M2PaF7 ( M

" spade " ) and σαυρος ( sauros - " lizard " ) . Agassiz consequently renamed the genus Platysaurus , probably from Greek πλατυς ( platys - " broad , flat , broad @-@ shouldered " ) , creating an invalid junior synonym . Later authors often referred to this derivation , and the secondary meaning " flat " of πλατυς , so that Plateosaurus is often translated as " flat lizard " . Often , claims were made that πλατυς is supposed to have been intended as a reference to flat bones , for example the laterally flattened teeth of Plateosaurus , but the teeth and other flat bones such as the pubic bones and some skull elements were unknown at the time of description .

0 ) , changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good ; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase . Goods necessary to survival can be classified here ; a rational person will be willing to pay anything for a good if the alternative is death . For example , a person in the desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet , no matter how much , for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die . His demand is not contingent on the price .

1 . If a balloon is punctured and spread flat it produces a disk ; this construction repairs the puncture , like pulling a drawstring . The slash , pronounced " modulo " , means to take the topological space on the left ( the disk ) and in it join together as one all the points on the right ( the circle ) . The region is 2 @-@ dimensional , which is why topology calls the resulting topological space a 2 @-@ sphere . Generalized , Dn / Sn − 1 produces Sn . For example , D1 is a line segment , and the construction joins its ends to make a circle . An equivalent description is that the boundary of an n @-@ dimensional disk is glued to a point , producing a CW complex .

even , require 0 to be even . Zero is the additive identity element of the group of even integers , and it is the starting case from which other even natural numbers are recursively defined . Applications of this recursion from graph theory to computational geometry rely on zero being even . Not only is 0 divisible by 2 , it is divisible by every power of 2 , which is relevant to the binary numeral system used by computers . In this sense , 0 is the " most even " number of all .

qb + r and f ( r ) < f ( b ) . An example of this mapping is the norm function used to order the Gaussian integers above . The function f can be the magnitude of the number , or the degree of a polynomial . The basic principle is that each step of the algorithm reduces f inexorably ; hence , if f can be reduced only a finite number of times , the algorithm must stop in a finite number of steps . This principle relies heavily on the natural well @-@ ordering of the non @-@ negative integers ; roughly speaking , this requires that every non @-@ empty set of non @-@ negative integers has a smallest member .

3 × 3 × 7 , the product of their shared prime factors . If two numbers have no prime factors in common , their greatest common divisor is 1 ( obtained here as an instance of the empty product ) , in other words they are coprime . A key advantage of the Euclidean algorithm is that it can find the GCD efficiently without having to compute the prime factors . Factorization of large integers is believed to be a computationally very difficult problem , and the security of many modern cryptography systems is based upon its infeasibility .

V for each i , the resulting direct sum can be written in exponential notation as V ⊕ N , or simply VN with the understanding that the direct sum is the default . We can again replace the set N with a cardinal number n to get Vn , although without choosing a specific standard set with cardinality n , this is defined only up to isomorphism . Taking V to be the field R of real numbers ( thought of as a vector space over itself ) and n to be some natural number , we get the vector space that is most commonly studied in linear algebra , the real vector space Rn .

f ( x ) is differentiable at a , then f must also be continuous at a . As an example , choose a point a and let f be the step function that returns a value , say 1 , for all x less than a , and returns a different value , say 10 , for all x greater than or equal to a. f cannot have a derivative at a . If h is negative , then a + h is on the low part of the step , so the secant line from a to a + h is very steep , and as h tends to zero the slope tends to infinity . If h is positive , then a + h is on the high part of the step , so the secant line from a to a + h has slope zero . Consequently , the secant lines do not approach any single slope , so the limit of the difference quotient does not exist .

Δx2 + Δy2 + Δz2 remains the same . Invariant theory was an active area of research in the later nineteenth century , prompted in part by Felix Klein 's Erlangen program , according to which different types of geometry should be characterized by their invariants under transformations , e.g. , the cross @-@ ratio of projective geometry . The archetypal example of an invariant is the discriminant B2 − 4AC of a binary quadratic form Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 . This is called an invariant because it is unchanged by linear substitutions x → ax + by , y → cx + dy with determinant ad − bc

u + vi , where u and v are ordinary integers and i is the square root of negative one . By defining an analog of the Euclidean algorithm , Gaussian integers can be shown to be uniquely factorizable , by the argument above . This unique factorization is helpful in many applications , such as deriving all Pythagorean triples or proving Fermat 's theorem on sums of two squares . In general , the Euclidean algorithm is convenient in such applications , but not essential ; for example , the theorems can often be proven by other arguments .
